# HyperFrames integration into OpenCut

## Scope and completion requirements

Branch: `מיזוג-עם-העורך-של-Hyper-frames` (spaces normalized for Git).
Keep the full editor in `classic/` and its existing timeline. Projects must accept
HyperFrames compositions alongside ordinary clips, over them as layers, or alone.
Preserve all existing editing, AI, account, storage, preview and export features.
Improve the existing interface and performance based on measured differences.

This document tracks an ongoing integration. The source import contract below
is implemented; the product integration is not complete.

| Requirement | Evidence needed | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated branch | Git branch at the canonical repository | Created |
| Study UI, timeline, element model and performance | Source audit, visual comparison, measured baselines | Source audit started; visual comparison and benchmarks pending |
| Lossless source import into existing document | Registry tests, original source roundtrip, native clips unchanged | Implemented in Editor API; Classic bridge pending |
| Folder/project import in the full editor | Import from user-selected Brag folder; resources persist across reopen | Pending |
| Mixed, overlaid and standalone compositions | Existing Classic timeline, live preview and export for all three | Pending |
| Editable composition children | Expand/collapse in existing lanes; select, trim, move, source/variable editing and undo | Pending |
| Full-fidelity playback | GSAP, CSS, media, fonts, nested hosts, generated DOM; seek/trim/speed/audio tests | Pending |
| Export parity | Representative frame and audio comparisons to pinned HyperFrames | Pending |
| Clearer existing UI | Browser review of hierarchy, labels, source status, selection and keyboard behavior | Pending |

## Inspected evidence (2026-10-03)

Upstream source: [heygen-com/hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes),
commit `b7343e3a95791bdc3448eddd6f00b4e73128b345`. Read-only local reference at
`.local/hyperframes-upstream`. Upstream uses Apache-2.0; preserve its license and
notices if code is reused. The current Rust source-package code is original.

User reference directory: `C:\Users\etiez\OneDrive\Documents\ChatGPT\Brag`.
`brag-reconstruction-2026-10-03/advanced-audio-test-final` pins HyperFrames 0.8.91:
720×1280, 30 fps, 6 seconds. Its inline script generates the visual scenes.
`npx --yes hyperframes@0.8.91 timeline --json` from that project reports only the
authored narration row. This is direct evidence that static HTML extraction alone
cannot reproduce this user's composition layers. Inspection did not modify the
reference project or its version pin.

### UI and timeline

- Studio composes its existing timeline from lane, ruler, playhead and overlay
  parts (`packages/studio/src/player/components/Timeline.tsx`). Exported Studio
  components need host contexts; mounting the complete Studio would introduce a
  second editor state and does not meet this task.
- `timelineViewportGeometry.ts` selects a visible time window with overscan and
  preserves a row anchor when geometry changes. Useful for expanding nested
  compositions without jumping the scroll position.
- `useTimelinePlayerLoop.ts` reads the playback adapter and broadcasts time to
  direct DOM subscribers; React state is synchronized at transport boundaries.
- Visual inspection of the already-open Studio at `localhost:3002` showed a
  96.9-second Brag project: fixed track names and clip counts, compact labeled
  thumbnail clips, one toolbar, a central preview, and a contextual inspector.
  The useful improvement is hierarchy and readable selection/context, not merely
  copying its colors. The reference also reports lint errors; its appearance
  does not establish source correctness or performance.
- Classic already has indexed/virtualized track layouts and a playhead subscribed
  to playback events (`visible-track-layouts.ts`, `use-timeline-playhead.ts`).
  Measure remaining layout work before replacing these mechanisms.
- First Classic improvement: move its existing playhead with `translateX`
  instead of changing `left` every frame. Geometry, scrolling, keyboard seeking
  and canonical playback events remain in place. Browser timing measurements
  are still required before reporting a speedup.

### Source, layers and timing

- HTML/CSS/JS plus media form the project; `data-*` attributes describe authored
  timing. The live runtime resolves script-created nodes, media durations and
  expressions (`core/src/runtime/startResolver.ts`, `clipTree.ts`).
- A display lane is not compositing z-order. Preserve source CSS and host nesting.
- The same source can appear in multiple host slots. Use an occurrence-scoped key
  plus source-file identity, not a global author ID, to address child layers.
- A root composition must stay intact for fidelity: flattening its children into
  unrelated native text/shape clips loses CSS, shared animation and dependencies.
- Classic's existing `graphics/html-raster.ts` strips scripts/audio/video and
  rasterizes CSS fragments through SVG. Keep that feature; add a separate renderer
  for full HyperFrames compositions.

### Playback and rendering

- The runtime provides a common seek contract. Its transport clock can follow
  audio and handles stalls (`core/src/runtime/clock.ts`). One OpenCut transport
  must drive composition time, trim offset and speed.
- Engine services include browser pooling, `beginFrame` capture, streamed FFmpeg
  encoding and parallel capture. Their presence is not a measured speed claim.
- Use a persistent isolated composition runtime for preview and deterministic
  capture for export; rebuilding HTML or screenshotting it on every preview
  frame would discard the main performance advantage.
- All generated binary results must use the bounded `ArtifactStore`. Durable
  imported media belongs to project media storage, not expiring output artifacts.

## Implemented contract and migration status

**Canonical contract and browser binding implemented; Classic project/UI
integration pending.** No alternate timeline was added. No Classic feature was
removed. The browser binding runs the same `OpenCutRuntime`; it is not yet the
owner of the existing Classic project managers.

- `hyperframes.project.inspect`: pure bounded source inspection, no script
  execution, filesystem reads or URL fetching. Reports authored elements,
  instance hierarchy, references and unresolved runtime needs.
- `timeline.hyperframes.import`: explicit project ID and expected revision;
  source becomes a typed `MediaAsset.hyperframes` and one existing `compound`
  timeline item. Omitted start appends; explicit start overlays. An existing
  video/overlay track can be selected; otherwise adds an overlay track to the
  same timeline. Native project resolution, frame rate and existing items stay
  unchanged. Registry projects MCP automatically.
- Registry idempotency metadata, dry run, cancellation checks, undo/redo and
  canonical `app.state.read` are covered by tests.
- Registry retry receipts now distinguish dry runs from commits, so reusing a
  request key after an import preview still performs the real write once.
- Source text is retained exactly. Binary dependency paths bind to existing
  OpenCut media asset IDs. Unbound dependencies are reported in inspection.
- Immutable source packages are shared across in-memory snapshots and undo
  history, while saved JSON remains self-contained. Asset lookup during document
  validation is indexed so native clips do not scan the whole asset library.
- Schema version 4 adds the optional composition payload; older documents
  migrate through the existing exact-time migration.
- The FFmpeg-only renderer rejects a HyperFrames source asset explicitly until
  its composition renderer is installed; it must never silently omit it.

### Canonical runtime in the browser

- `classic/rust/editor-runtime-wasm` exposes the live capability registry,
  read-only snapshots, portable session bytes and bounded artifact reads. It
  depends directly on `crates/editor-api`; it has no independent editor model.
- `loadCanonicalRuntime()` is an asynchronous import. The registry and JSON
  Schema validators live in their own WASM module. An initial combined build
  increased the main Classic binary from 3,919,268 to 10,021,797 bytes; the
  separate build restores the main binary to exactly 3,919,268 bytes; the lazy
  runtime module is 6,304,295 bytes. This is a size check, not a playback speed
  measurement. Build and export checks cover both packages. The dev launcher
  checks for both generated binaries, and Webpack/TypeScript resolve their
  local generated packages together to avoid stale Bun package copies.
- Platform clocks, random initialization and Tokio features now support
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Native filesystem/process capabilities remain
  discoverable with an explicit unavailable reason in a browser. Metadata-only
  media registration, source inspection and canonical editing remain available.
- Session persistence now separates serialization/validated restoration from
  native filesystem access. A failed restore leaves the document unchanged.
  A successful restore clears old retry receipts so an earlier receipt cannot
  falsely claim that an edit exists after loading an older saved revision.
- Actual WASM execution under Node verifies mixed import, byte-for-byte source
  preservation, dry run followed by commit with the same retry key, stale
  revision rejection, undo/redo, session restore, invalid-restore rollback,
  native capability rejection and bounded artifact access. These are runtime
  tests, not an end-to-end Classic UI or rendering test.
- A read-only WASM probe inspected all eight Brag packages and imported the
  seven with authored numeric durations into one canonical timeline. Restoring
  the serialized session reproduced the document. The eighth package needs
  live duration resolution; no duration was guessed. Media remained unbound
  in this source-only probe. Local probe: `.local/hyperframes-wasm-probe.mjs`.
  The final release probe took 445 ms to initialize the registry and about
  4–18 ms per import on this machine under Node. This excludes resource copying,
  browser UI work, script execution and rendering; those still need measurement.

## Next implementation sequence

1. Static inspection has now passed on all eight supplied Brag project folders.
   The 96.9-second reconstruction contains 52 authored inventory elements; one
   generated project has no authored root duration. Encoded UTF-8 and root-relative
   package references are covered. Finish dependency resolution and live manifests.
2. Establish Classic-to-canonical transactions for composition import and edits.
   The Classic bridge currently advertises Classic tools but does not synchronize
   the full Classic document with `OpenCutRuntime`. The lazy WASM binding is now
   available. The remaining boundary must preserve every Classic scene, feature
   field and durable resource binding and return a view of the committed state.
   Classic commands are synchronous; the registry binding is asynchronous. Align
   that transaction boundary and the existing undo stack before exposing import,
   so the two histories cannot drift. Do not hydrate an empty parallel project
   and call it integration with the existing editor.
3. Add user-selected folder import, durable asset bindings and a persistent
   isolated HyperFrames preview adapter to the Classic renderer. Route all
   transport and edits through canonical transactions. Resource serving must be
   scoped to the imported package; keep local control endpoints authenticated
   and loopback-only.
4. Project runtime-generated child manifests into expandable rows of the existing
   timeline, retain host occurrence identity, and connect selection/inspector.
5. Add deterministic frame and audio export, bounded artifact output, cancellation
   and cache invalidation. Verify actual Brag projects and mixed compositions.
6. Implement measured UI/performance improvements; run the full preservation and
   completion audit above. Do not equate green source-import tests with completion.

## Validation commands

```powershell
cargo test -p opencut-editor-api --test hyperframes
cargo test -p opencut-editor-api
cargo run -p opencut-editor-api --example inspect_hyperframes -- <project-directory>
cd classic
wasm-pack test --node rust/editor-runtime-wasm
bun run build:wasm
```

The example is a read-only static source probe; it skips generated output, hidden
directories, dependencies and symlinks, and reports binary references as unbound.

### Current verification and outstanding baseline failures

- Editor API: 20 existing tests and 8 HyperFrames integration tests passed.
- MCP: all 12 tests passed, including registry projection and atomic rollback.
- Editor API Clippy with `-D warnings` passed, including the final source-sharing
  change. Editor API and MCP tests were rerun successfully after that change.
- Canonical browser binding: all three WASM integration tests passed after the
  separate-module change, including retry behavior after restoration. The 28
  Editor API and 12 MCP tests passed again after adding portable persistence.
- Both release WASM packages built successfully; 37 existing Classic exports
  and 7 canonical runtime exports passed the binary contract check. Clippy with
  `-D warnings` passed for the native Editor API and the WASM binding, including
  tests. The loader passed ESLint.
- Classic: 36 tests passed for timeline components, playhead geometry and audio
  silence defaults. Two stale audio assertions were corrected to the intentional
  0.3-second default from commit `b2b7d03e`; product behavior was preserved.
- The broader Classic timeline invocation reports 62 passes, 4 failures and
  2 module errors. `cut-silence.test.ts` also fails in isolation: its
  `mock.module("opencut-wasm")` omits `resolveAudioSyncRetrim`, now imported by
  the audio timing code. The real WASM was rebuilt and all 37 required exports,
  including this one, passed `verify-wasm-exports.mjs`. This is an outstanding
  test-harness issue, not evidence of successful full regression coverage.
- Local Next.js returned HTTP 200 for `/projects` on loopback port 3100. Browser
  inspection reached the account setup gate on that separate origin; live
  playhead behavior and end-to-end import remain unverified. No user account or
  existing project was changed for this probe.
